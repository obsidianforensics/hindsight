# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.
If you find something suspicious, we encourage and appreciate your report!

### Ways to report

In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the "Security" tab in the GitHub project.
This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.

If you are absolutely unable to or have strong reasons not to use GitHub's vulnerability reporting workflow, please reach out via email at [ryan@hindsig.ht](mailto:ryan@hindsig.ht).

### Timing Expectations

This is a small project maintained by volunteers. While we appreciate bug and vulnerability reports, we cannot commit to any timelines for addressing them. In the spirit of this, 
when reporting a bug or vulnerability, please provide as much information as possible to help us fix the problem. PRs are welcome as well!
